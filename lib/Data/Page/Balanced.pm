=head1 NAME

Data::Page::Balanced - A data pager that will balance the number of entries per page.


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Data::Page::Balanced version 1.0.0


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Data::Page::Balanced;

    my $pager = Data::Page::Balanced->new({
        total_entries => 67,
        entries_per_page => 25
    });
    
    print $pager->last_page() # 2
    print $pager->entries_per_page() # 34
  
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module behaves like L<Data::Page> except that it balances the number of entries per page so there is no last page with only a few entries. If, for example, you have 26 entries and want 25 entries per page, a normal pager would give you two pages with 25 entries on the first and 1 on the last. Data::Page::Balanced will instead give you one page with 26 entries.

The benefit of a balanced number of entries per page is greater when the number of pages is small, with the ideal case being when there are two pages with only one entry on the last, in which case Data::Page::Balanced will fold it over to the first page. This saves the user from having to navigate to a page with only one entry, making it easier for him or her to see all the entries at once.

The default flexibility is C<floor(entries_per_page/2)>, which means that in the example with 25 entries per page, the calculated entries per page can go up to 37 (25 + 12). The flexibility can be changed both at initialization and later on.


=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS 

=head2 new

    my $pager = Data::Page::Balanced->new({
        total_entries => 67,
        entries_per_page => 25,
        current_page => 1,
        flexibility => 12
    });

This constructs a new pager object. The C<total_entries> and C<entries_per_page> arguments are mandatory, since they are used to calculate the actual number of entries per page.

The C<current_page> and C<flexibility> arguments are optional.

All arguments are given as name-value pairs in an anonymous hash.

=head2 total_entries

    $pager->total_entries(100); # Sets the total entries to 100
    $pager->total_entries();    # Returns the current total entries

This will get or set the total entries. I<Changing this will re-calculate the number of entries per page.>

=head2 entries_per_page

    $pager->entries_per_page(23); # Sets the entries per page to 23
    $pager->entries_per_page();   # Returns the current entries per page

This will get or set the entries per page. I<Since changing this will re-calculate the number of entries per page according to the flexibility, in most cases what you set is not what you later will get.>

=head2 flexibility

    $pager->flexibility(12); # Sets the flexibility to 12
    $pager->flexibility();   # Returns the current flexibility

This will get or set the flexibility value. I<Changing this will re-calculate the number of entries per page.>


=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item C<< total_entries and entries_per_page must be supplied. >>

The C<total_entries> and C<entries_per_page> arguments has to be supplied when initializing a new object.

=item C<< There must be at least one entry per page. %d is too small. >>

The number of entries per page is not allowed to be smaller than 1.
